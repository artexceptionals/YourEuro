<h1>Project Team Presentation</h1><br>
<h3><i>Hey folks! Welcome to the blog on "YourEuro - a Money Control app" worked upon by our diligent team.</i></h3>
  
 <hr><br>
 
 <h1>Our Project</h1><br>
 <p>In this project we intend to develop an app for “Money control”. Saving money and keeping track of the spending is a very hectic task, It’s always necessary for each one of us to track the money flow for efficient financial management. Our App “YOUREURO” will not only keep the track of money flow, but will also give a statistical analysis.</p>

<h1>Team ARTexceptionals</h1><br>
<p>Inspired by the “AndroidRuntimeException”, our team has moved on from the old school Dalvik virtual Machine and has adopted  Android Runtime.</p>

<p>The team Moto is as below: </p>
<p><i>try{<br/>
printf(“Making innovative apps”);<br/>
}catch{<br/>
printf(“Market needs”); <br/>
}finally{<br/>
printf(“Deliver Awesome apps”);<br/>
}</i></p>

<p>"Personally, I love coding and strive for optimisation and perfection. One of the core qualities which I lack Is knowledge sharing . I believe working in a team would help me bridge this skill and boost the overall team work. As the saying goes “Don’t just look at the end result, look at the intermediate process as well”, this course will make us learn A to Z of software engineering and not just the C for coding part".</p>
<h2>Anitha Bhat Talagini Ashoka</h2>

<p>"Being a curious head I always loved learning new things. Developing an app in the Android operating system will not only enhance my coding skills but will also help me to explore new development environment. This course will nurture me to complete my zeal to become a good Software Engineer with boosting up my team working skills".</p>
<h2>Madhu Gopal Sirivella</h2>

<p>"Coming from an Instrumentation engineering background I would like to gain the necessary skills required for Software Engineering. The motivation behind taking this course is I will get exposure to the various phases of developing an Android App. I believe by doing this course I can enhance my coding skills. I am excited to work in a team where we combine work to achieve a higher objective".</p>

<h2>Avinash Ranjan</h2>

<p>"Honestly, my expertise in coding is basic. But I always had an interest in knowing how a particular app works and how to make a new app. Taking software engineering will really help me in knowing the background knowledge of making and working of an app. The Agile Manifesto here will promote simplification and individuals and interactions over processes and tools. So, taking up this course will not only help me making of an app but will also help me in presenting my app in front of people".</p>

<h1>Complementary Skills</h1><br/>
<p>A project doesn’t just comprise of coding. It is just a minor part of it. Engineers tend to forget this which leads to a delivery of a bad product. Our team is a group of diverse people with varied skills. All of us have a minimum experience of 2-3 years and thus have already been part of different product development. But now it’s time to use those gained knowledge and skills along with the coding skills used across different courses to good use. Presentation , documentation, agile management, creativity, leadership, pressure handling, and last but not the least Programming are the key skills that exist among the team members and each one of us is eager to learn from one another.</p>

<br><br><hr>

<h1>Communication</h1><br/>
<p>We are using github for code upload and maintaining the blogs , Whatsapp for daily communication and Trello for scrum management, trello having an android app will make things simpler and active. We have scheduled weekly meeting on Fridays after class hours where sprint challenges and blockers will be tried to be solved.</p>

<h1>Flexibility</h1><br/>
  
  <p>A product comes into its true colour only when each of the jigsaw pieces align properly. A team functions smoothly only when the team members work together. The gaps in the skills of one person needs to be covered by some other. Keeping this in mind, we will have regular standup meets to identify these gaps, discuss the challenges and help each other in growing as individual. Even though we have assigned roles for ourselves, we are not sandboxing ourselves to its parameters. This mindset is necessary for the flexibility of the team and thereby working seamlessly.</p>
