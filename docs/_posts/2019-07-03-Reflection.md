<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><i> Hello folks! Welcome to our penultimate blog of the series for ‘YourEuro’ - A money control app. In this blog we discuss about  our whole experience as working in team and difficulties encountered while developing the app.</i></p>

<h1>Technical challenges?</h1>
<p>Technical challenges, are less a solution to all of problems than a puzzle that needs to be constantly assessed and configured to make sure everything is going in a pace, by constantly getting called upon to adapt learnings and break down new barriers.

</p> 
    <ul>
        <li><p>Three of our team members were not well aware of the android platform and MVC architecture, learning and understanding the concepts took time initially. Hence development burden was on single person.</p></li>
        <li><p>Due to our misconception in requirements, made us to rebuild few of the app functionalities.</p></li>
        <li><p>Creating blog and adding libraries through Github was challenging.</p></li>
        <li><p>Debugging the errors took more time than expected.</p></li>
        <li><p>Faced difficulties while working and merging the code parallelly in Git. </p></li>
    </ul>

<h1>Role of team work</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Knowledge sharing is major take away from the project.</p></li>
        <li><p>Dividing the task made work easier.</p></li>
        <li><p>Driving each others to work, made deadlines less scarier.</p></li>
        <li><p>Learning is fun when you learn from friends.</p></li>
        <li><p>Approaching the problem with different perspective lead us to a better solution. </p></li>
        <li><p>Working in a team developed not only technical skills but also improved management and communication competence.</p></li>
    </ul>

<h1>Challenges experienced as a team</h1>
<p>Every project will have its own sets of hurdles, and getting a good throughput means overcoming those hurdles. Due to the nature of working in teams, group members can sometimes find that they are not working effectively, which negatively impacts on their progress, and their ability to be successful.</p>

<p>Some common problems identified while working in team are:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li><p>Tasks were not getting completed on time which led to a Doppler effect and too much work for single person</p></li>
        <li><p>Communication is not always easy, that's how humans are!</p></li>
        <li><p>Collabaration of team members for particular task on common time slot was challenging</p></li>
        <li><p>Learning is fun, but it is a long process.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
<p>But in the end, what mattered was how we overcame these challeges to successfully complete the assigned tasks and get the best out of everything.</p>

<h1>About the course</h1>
   <ul>
        <li><p>This course helped us to know more about the Android App development, agile methodology and team work</p></li>
        <li><p>We got the chance to work and gain skills in java,android studio, html and learnt more about Github. </p></li>
        <li><p>Learnt how an entire software engineering project works in agile. From requirements analysis, designing, development  until the testing of the application.</p></li>
        <li><p>This project gave an abstract idea of work culture in corparate sector.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our team 'ARTExceptionals' would like to thank Dr. Schulze for granting us the opportunity to develop our skills in a very practical approach.We would also like to thank Dean D'souza for bringing the best out of us by his regular inputs and feedbacks.</p>
